This repository provides code in supplement to "Separating internal and externally-forced contributions to global temperature variability using a Bayesian stochastic energy balance framework" (M. Schillinger et al. 2022) accepted in Chaos: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science. A preprint of the manuscript is available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14573 .

## Prerequisites

Running the code in this repository requires the following [R](https://www.r-project.org/) packages:

- `ClimBayes` from https://github.com/paleovar/ClimBayes (latest release v.0.1.1)
- `dplyr`
- `ggplot2` 
- `tibble` 
- `PaleoSpec` 
- `RColorBrewer`
- `zoo`
- `ggpubr`
- `purrr`
- `stringr`
- `latex2exp`
- `tidyr`

## Pre-processing

The directory `./output/` contains the pre-processed data, which we obtained from fitting the stochastic two-box energy balance model (EBM) to global mean surface temperature (GMST) data using the [*ClimBayes*](https://github.com/paleovar/ClimBayes) package in R. The target data (Table 1 of submitted manuscript) is available from the data holdings of the Climate Research Programmeâ€™s Working, from Schmidt et al., Eby et al. (https://climate.uvic.ca/EMICAR5/participants.html), and Morice et al.. The *ClimBayes* package provides detailed information on how to prepare and fit the target data (see vignette... ). To reproduce our runs, use the `ebm_fit_config.yml` in the respective `./output/` directory and the `ebm_fit()` function from *ClimBayes*. We used `n_boxes=2` and `detrending=2`. 

`ebm_fit(temp_data, 
         forc_data,
         start_year,
         end_year,
         n_boxes,
         config,
         detrending,
         config_file)`
