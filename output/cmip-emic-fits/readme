these runs are taken from output-current/detrended_both_850_1850
end output-current/detrended_both_850_1850_emics

the config file in all cases is the same with one exception:
the start value for the SD of the noise for CMIPs and Loveclim members is 0.1
for other EMICs and Loveclim ensemble mean it is 0.05

for EMICs, the run with the best gelman diag was taken and then renamed to fit the usual pattern
this was:
C2 - v4
ME - v4

best versions, but still not good enough:
UM - v2 (1.20)
DC - v7 (2.35)
